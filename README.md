# Regression-Analysis-S-P500
Report of a Regression Analysis of the S&amp;P 500 from March 30th to June 28th 2021

The analysis creates a linear model of weekly percent change. Model was checked for linearity, constant variance, and normality assumptions.
Futher details can be found within the reports.

Results
Under the first model fit we observed an increase in the value of the S&P 500. Under the second model, fit2,
observing percent change there was a lack of evidence to reject β1 = 0 with a p-value of 0.1647 and a 95%
confidence interval which included zero CI(-0.06,0.01). The point estimate of β0 was found to be approximately 0.7
with a 95% CI of (0.12,1.28) and a p-value of 0.018. The value of β0 indicates that on average there has been about
a 0.7% gain in value per week during March 30th, 2020 and June 28, 2021

Discussion
There were promising trends in several of the models but statistical analysis did not provide sufficient evidence to
conclude that short term gains were any different than zero. Further examination of the constant trend of the market
provided sufficient evidence that there was an average gain of value in the S&P 500 of approximately 0.7% over the
period of time analyzed. One of the limitations of this analysis is that it is not able to make any recommendations on
short term trends within the index fund due to volatility within the market.

Conclusion
It is our recommendation that investments within the S&P 500 should be made with consistent growth expected over
time. Short-term buys and sells of this stock are not recommended.
